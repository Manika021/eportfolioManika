										<h4>Work Experience</h4>
										<p>I have over 5 years working experience at Nestle Central and Western Africa and my work allowed me to work with difference suboffices on diverse business issues.  My primary roles involved improving the payroll and procurement systems across the region, but these were all done with a marketing lens, to ensure that Nestle remained a market leader in that area.  
											I have a track record of being dependable and using initiative to proactively solve problems in the workplace. Working with different teams, we found solutions that helped to improve overall KPIs in the region. Due to the roles that I played in different successful projects, I was allowed to organize training programs for officials in the region to ensure that Nestle achieved first time rights in the region for different products.  I also have experience using Microsoft Office Applications, SAP, Power Bi, and SUCCESSFACTORS, and I have SQL certification.
